(multiple) Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (mSVM-RFE)
========

**Full documentation is available at: <http://www.colbyimaging.com/wiki/statistics/msvm-rfe>**

This package contains an [R](http://www.r-project.org) implementation of the mSVM-RFE algorithm ([Duan et al., 2005](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16220686)), including the option to cut the features by half each round (instead of one-by-one) if there are many features.

The main function is adapted from <http://www.uccor.edu.ar/paginas/seminarios/Software/SVM_RFE_R_implementation.pdf>.

Also included are tools for wrapping the feature ranking/selection process in an external layer of cross-validation for obtaining unbiased estimates of generalization error/accuracy (See [Ambroise et al., 2002](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11983868)).

This entire process can be massively parallelized, and an example implementation is included that uses the [SGE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine) cluster interface.
